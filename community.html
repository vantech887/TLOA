        <p class="outside text">1. Yeshua (Jesus) is the one and only door to salvation, God offers forgiveness of sins through His one and only Son, and upon belief you are grafted into the commonwealth of Israel and must live faithfully towards God as you would any marriage agreement. This message goes to the non believers. <br> 2. When we have the time and opportunity to meet believers we encourage them to repent of their anti-Torah attitude and turn to the way, truth and life (Pslam 119). Yeshua is the living Torah and instructs us to also follow Him as He lived by obeying the Fathers commandments (Mathew 5:17-19, Roman's 3:31, Revelation 12:17) <br> Follow us on Tiktok and subscribe on YouTube.</p>

You can just call me the SheepWolf. I honestly prefer it. My story of origin began in Minnesota, late summer of 89’, August 25th to be exact. My birth name is Scott Richard Sundvall. I’m the son of a carpenter father and a British born mother. I have Swedish blood mainly and of course some English blood. I even recently discovered that I have lineage to a Doctor that came over on the Mayflower. I was a completely normal child until my parents noticed that something was off. I had an awkward gait. I also had difficulty getting up from a sitting position. At 3 years old I was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
