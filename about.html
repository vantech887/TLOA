                <p>Welcome to my lair brethren. Let me introduce myself. My name is Scoty “SheepWolf” Sundvall. You can just call me the SheepWolf. I honestly prefer it. </p>

                <p>My story of origin began in Minnesota, late summer of 89’, August 25th to be exact. My birth name is Scott Richard Sundvall. I’m the son of a carpenter father and a British born mother. I have Swedish blood mainly and of course some English blood. I even recently discovered that I have lineage to a Doctor that came over on the Mayflower. I was a completely normal child until my parents noticed that something was off. I had an awkward gait. I also had difficulty getting up from a sitting position. At 3 years old I was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It’s a cruel and tyrannical disease that destroys your ability to absorb protein and slowly eats away at your body. First it takes your ability to walk. I lost that at 9 years old.</p>

            <div class="text-wrapper third-txt">
                <p>Then at 16 it took away my core strength. I lost my ability to sit up on my own. Around that time I also lost my ability to fully move my arms. As of right now I can just move my wrists slightly.

                    Sorry my brethren, but it gets much worse than that. At 22 I found out that my throat muscles were not working properly. I had no choice but to get a feeding tube placed in my stomach. I was losing too much weight. At my worst I think I was 56lbs. About a year after that, my lungs started to be affected by the illness. My diaphragm took a beating and I had to be put on a ventilator. I’m 31 now. I’ve been on it for about 8 years. Then finally I had to withstand heart problems. I believe I was 24 when that shit went down. I’m on permanent medication now.
                    
                    Now you know how badass I am. Death hasn’t been able to take me down. Hell, the doctors put an expiration date on me: 18 years! Ha! The curse those suckers put on me didn’t come to pass. Here is a line from one of my favorite songs, “my life is a constant war, my life is a constant fight” – Death Will Reign by Impending Doom. Through the hardship and endless bombardment, I became the SheepWolf.</p>

            <div class="text-wrapper fourth-txt">
                <p>Through the trials I have become battle tested. Through the gauntlet my teeth have been sharpened. I am the survivor. I am the slayer. Most importantly, I am a faithful man of God. My journey with the Lord began in 04’ or I should say the year of my recruitment. My encounter actually happened out of state. It took place down in Georgia. They say the devil went down to Georgia. What they didn’t tell you is he got his ass kicked out because he stepped into God’s territory.

                    I think what started the whole thing was a mention of miraculous healing. My family and I were desperate for a breakthrough concerning my disease. There was a church seminar taking place in the south east corner of the country. Little did I know my life was about to change. Not in the way I wanted it to, but the way that it needed to. The seminar was called A More Excellent Way. It’s named very appropriately because what I experienced was truly a more excellent way. I am not sure where to begin. While I was there I learned about generational curses. I witnessed people being delivered from demonic spirit. I learned about the dangers of cursed objects, the opening and closing spiritual door points. Basically, I trained in the art of spiritual warfare.</p>

            <div class="text-wrapper final-txt">
                <p>The seminar lasted about a week. It was a lot of information to cram into my 14 year old mind. This event is where my spiritual awakening took place. I received some information stating that a generational curse is the reason for my illness. Something about wrong order in the home. In the Bible it states, “wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing (Ephesians 5:22-24).” I’ll cover this more on a future episode.

                    With the new understanding I was given, the next step was to learn how to break the curse that was bestowed upon me through my mother’s side of the family. I spent years trying to get healed, but nothing ever happened. Remember, I said my life would change the way I needed it to, not necessarily the way I wanted it to. Recently I discovered John 9:1-5. It says, “Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him. I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” The seminar was great, but the pastors leading it had the belief that every sickness was influenced by demonic spirits or curses. Biblically though, that is simply not true. Don’t get me wrong. Generational curses do exist, but it’s not the case in every situation. I believe the reason I didn’t get healed is it wasn’t God’s will. He must’ve had something else planned for me. The journey to Georgia wasn’t a total bust. That is where I got baptised. It is where I became a soldier for the Lord. I am the SheepWolf. I am a servant of the most high God. I will overcome.</p>
